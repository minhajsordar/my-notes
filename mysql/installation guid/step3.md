```
Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.

Please check that the mysqli PHP extension is installed and enabled.
```

The error message you're seeing indicates that WordPress requires the MySQLi extension to interact with the MySQL database, but itâ€™s either not installed or not enabled on your server.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the `mysqli` extension is installed and enabled in PHP. Follow the steps below to install and enable the MySQLi extension for PHP on your system:

### **For Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems:**

1. **Update your package list:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install the MySQLi PHP extension:**

   You can install the MySQLi extension using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install php-mysqli -y
   ```

   This will install the `mysqli` extension and all necessary dependencies.

3. **Restart Apache:**

   After installing the extension, you need to restart Apache for the changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

4. **Verify that the MySQLi extension is installed:**

   You can check if the `mysqli` extension is enabled by running the following command:

   ```bash
   php -m | grep mysqli
   ```

   If `mysqli` is installed and enabled, this command will output `mysqli`.

### **For CentOS/RHEL-based Systems:**

1. **Update your package list:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   ```

2. **Install the MySQLi PHP extension:**

   Install the MySQLi extension for PHP using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install php-mysqli -y
   ```

   If you're using PHP 7 or higher, `php-mysqlnd` (the MySQL Native Driver) package may be installed, which also includes the MySQLi extension. To ensure everything is installed, use:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install php-mysqlnd
   ```

3. **Restart Apache or PHP-FPM:**

   If you are using Apache, restart it:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

   If you are using Nginx with PHP-FPM, restart PHP-FPM:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
   ```

4. **Verify that the MySQLi extension is installed:**

   You can check if the `mysqli` extension is enabled by running:

   ```bash
   php -m | grep mysqli
   ```

   If the extension is installed, it should return `mysqli`.

### **Check PHP Configuration:**

If the above steps don't work, or if the MySQLi extension is installed but not enabled, you may need to check the `php.ini` file to ensure that the `mysqli` extension is not commented out.

1. **Find the location of your `php.ini` file:**

   Run the following command to find the `php.ini` file location:

   ```bash
   php --ini
   ```

2. **Edit the `php.ini` file:**

   Open the `php.ini` file in a text editor (replace the path with the actual path you found above):

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini  # for Ubuntu (adjust PHP version accordingly)
   sudo nano /etc/php.ini  # for CentOS
   ```

3. **Uncomment the MySQLi extension:**

   Look for the line that loads the MySQLi extension (it might look like `;extension=mysqli.so`). Uncomment it by removing the semicolon (`;`), so it looks like this:

   ```ini
   extension=mysqli.so
   ```

4. **Restart Apache or PHP-FPM:**

   After making changes to the `php.ini` file, restart Apache or PHP-FPM again for the changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2  # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo systemctl restart httpd    # For CentOS
   sudo systemctl restart php-fpm  # For PHP-FPM with Nginx
   ```

### **Recheck WordPress Installation:**

Now, reload your WordPress site. The error about the missing MySQL extension should be resolved.

You can also confirm that the `mysqli` extension is active by viewing the PHP info page you created earlier (`info.php`) at `http://your_server_ip/info.php` and searching for `mysqli` in the output.
