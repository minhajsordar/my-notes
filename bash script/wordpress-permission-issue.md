The error message you're encountering, "To perform the requested action, WordPress needs to access your web server," typically occurs when WordPress doesn't have the necessary permissions to write files or directories on your server. This is a common issue when installing themes, plugins, or updates.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

---

### 1. **Check File Permissions**
WordPress requires write permissions for certain directories. Ensure the following directories have the correct permissions:
   - `wp-content/themes`
   - `wp-content/plugins`
   - `wp-content/uploads`

   **Recommended permissions:**
   - Directories: `755`
   - Files: `644`

   You can set these permissions using an FTP client or via SSH:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 wp-content/themes
   chmod -R 755 wp-content/plugins
   chmod -R 755 wp-content/uploads
   ```

---

### 2. **Check Ownership of Files**
Ensure the files and directories are owned by the correct user. If you're using a VPS, the web server user is typically `www-data` (for Apache) or `nginx` (for Nginx).

   To change ownership, use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/wordpress
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/wordpress` with the actual path to your WordPress installation.

---

### 3. **Enable FS_METHOD in `wp-config.php`**
You can explicitly define the file system method WordPress should use. Add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file:
   ```php
   define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');
   ```

   This tells WordPress to use direct file system access.

---

### 4. **Check PHP Configuration**
Ensure that PHP is running with the correct user permissions. If PHP is running under a different user (e.g., `apache` or `nginx`), it may not have access to the WordPress files.

   You can check the PHP user by creating a `phpinfo.php` file in your WordPress root directory:
   ```php
   <?php phpinfo(); ?>
   ```

   Access this file via your browser (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/phpinfo.php`) and look for the `USER` or `APACHE_RUN_USER` field.

---

### 5. **Disable File Modifications in `wp-config.php`**
If the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is set to `true` in your `wp-config.php` file, WordPress will block theme and plugin installations. Ensure this line is not present or is set to `false`:
   ```php
   define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', false);
   ```

---

### 6. **Check SELinux (if enabled)**
If your VPS uses SELinux, it might be restricting file access. You can temporarily disable SELinux to test if it's the cause:
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 0
   ```

   If this resolves the issue, you can adjust SELinux permissions for WordPress instead of disabling it entirely.

---

### 7. **Check Web Server Configuration**
Ensure your web server (Apache or Nginx) has the correct permissions to access the WordPress directory. For example, in Apache, check the `<Directory>` directive in your virtual host configuration.

---

### 8. **Use FTP Credentials**
If none of the above works, you can provide FTP credentials to WordPress for file management. Add the following lines to your `wp-config.php` file:
   ```php
   define('FTP_HOST', 'ftp.yourdomain.com');
   define('FTP_USER', 'your-ftp-username');
   define('FTP_PASS', 'your-ftp-password');
   define('FTP_SSL', false); // Set to true if using FTPS
   ```

---

### 9. **Check for Disk Space**
Ensure your server has enough disk space. If the disk is full, WordPress won't be able to write new files.

   Check disk usage:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

### 10. **Debugging**
Enable WordPress debugging to get more details about the error. Add the following lines to your `wp-config.php` file:
   ```php
   define('WP_DEBUG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
   ```

   Check the `wp-content/debug.log` file for more information.

The error message `Installation failed: Could not create directory` indicates that WordPress is unable to create the required directory for installing the theme or plugin. This is typically a **permissions** or **ownership** issue on your server. Let's go through the steps to resolve this:

---

### 1. **Check Directory Permissions**
Ensure the `wp-content` directory and its subdirectories (`themes`, `plugins`, `upgrade`, etc.) have the correct permissions. WordPress needs write access to these directories.

   Run the following commands via SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   ```

   If the `upgrade` directory doesn't exist, create it:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   sudo chmod 755 /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   ```

---

### 2. **Check File Ownership**
Ensure the files and directories are owned by the correct user. The web server user is typically `www-data` (for Apache) or `nginx` (for Nginx).

   Run the following command to change ownership:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/totocompanybd.com
   ```

   If you're unsure about the web server user, check your PHP configuration:
   - Create a `phpinfo.php` file in your WordPress root directory:
     ```php
     <?php phpinfo(); ?>
     ```
   - Access it via your browser (e.g., `https://totocompanybd.com/phpinfo.php`) and look for the `USER` or `APACHE_RUN_USER` field.

---

### 3. **Enable FS_METHOD in `wp-config.php`**
Add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file to allow WordPress to use direct file system access:
   ```php
   define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');
   ```

---

### 4. **Check SELinux (if enabled)**
If your server uses SELinux, it might be restricting file access. Temporarily disable SELinux to test if it's the cause:
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 0
   ```

   If this resolves the issue, adjust SELinux permissions for WordPress instead of disabling it entirely:
   ```bash
   sudo chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content
   ```

---

### 5. **Check Disk Space**
Ensure your server has enough disk space. If the disk is full, WordPress won't be able to create new directories or files.

   Check disk usage:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   If the disk is full, free up space by deleting unnecessary files or logs.

---

### 6. **Manually Create the Directory**
If the issue persists, manually create the `upgrade` directory and set the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   sudo chmod 755 /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/totocompanybd.com/wp-content/upgrade
   ```

---

### 7. **Debugging**
Enable WordPress debugging to get more details about the error. Add the following lines to your `wp-config.php` file:
   ```php
   define('WP_DEBUG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
   ```

   Check the `wp-content/debug.log` file for more information.

---

### 8. **Use FTP Credentials (Fallback)**
If none of the above works, you can provide FTP credentials to WordPress for file management. Add the following lines to your `wp-config.php` file:
   ```php
   define('FTP_HOST', 'ftp.yourdomain.com');
   define('FTP_USER', 'your-ftp-username');
   define('FTP_PASS', 'your-ftp-password');
   define('FTP_SSL', false); // Set to true if using FTPS
   ```

---

### 9. **Check Web Server Configuration**
Ensure your web server (Apache or Nginx) has the correct permissions to access the WordPress directory. For example, in Apache, check the `<Directory>` directive in your virtual host configuration.

---

### 10. **Restart Web Server**
After making changes, restart your web server to apply the new settings:
   - For Apache:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```
   - For Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```
