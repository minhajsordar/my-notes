### Copy deploy.sh content
then

### Usage:

1. **Create the script file**: 
   You can create this script by using the following command:

   ```bash
   nano deploy.sh
   ```

   Then paste the script into this file and save it.

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   chmod u+x deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script with domain name and email as arguments**:

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh linksharingapp.com example@gmail.com
   ```

This script will handle all the commands you were manually running before. You can modify this script further if needed to accommodate additional tasks, but it should now deploy your site with a single command.

Let me know if you need any further modifications!
