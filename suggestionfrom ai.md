Certainly! Here are a few examples of Apache virtual host configurations for hosting multiple domains on a single server:
Example 1:
<VirtualHost *:80> ServerName domain1.com DocumentRoot /var/www/domain1.com/public_html </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost *:80> ServerName domain2.com DocumentRoot /var/www/domain2.com/public_html </VirtualHost> 
Example 2:
<VirtualHost *:80> 
ServerName domain1.com 
ServerAlias www.domain1.com 
DocumentRoot /var/www/domain1.com/public_html </VirtualHost> 
<VirtualHost *:80> 
ServerName domain2.com 
ServerAlias www.domain2.com 
DocumentRoot /var/www/domain2.com/public_html </VirtualHost> 
Example 3:
<VirtualHost *:80> ServerName domain1.com DocumentRoot /var/www/domain1.com/public_html <Directory /var/www/domain1.com/public_html> AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> </VirtualHost> 
<VirtualHost *:80> 
ServerName domain2.com 
DocumentRoot /var/www/domain2.com/public_html 
<Directory /var/www/domain2.com/public_html> AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> 
</VirtualHost> 

Please note that you need to replace "domain1.com" and "domain2.com" with your actual domain names, and "/var/www/domain1.com/public_html" and "/var/www/domain2.com/public_html" with the correct paths to the document roots of your domains.
Remember to save the configuration file and restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

No, you don't have to write the example 1 code in the same file. In Apache, each virtual host configuration is typically stored in a separate file within the

/etc/apache2/sites-available/

directory. You can create a new file for each virtual host and name it according to your domain, for example,
domain1.com.conf
and
domain2.com.conf
.
To create a new virtual host configuration file, you can use the following command:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/domain1.com.conf 

This will open a text editor where you can paste the virtual host configuration code for
domain1.com
. Save the file and repeat the process for
domain2.com
by creating a new file
domain2.com.conf
.
After creating the configuration files, you need to enable the virtual hosts by creating symbolic links in the

/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

directory. You can use the following command:

sudo a2ensite domain1.com.conf sudo a2ensite domain2.com.conf 

Finally, restart Apache for the changes to take effect:

sudo service apache2 restart 

By following these steps, you can have separate configuration files for each virtual host and keep them organized.
